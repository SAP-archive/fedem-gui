Before a new public release, the following needs to be done here.

1. Generate new GUIDs in the CaMain.idl file.
   Use, e.g., https://www.guidgenerator.com and generate <nuid> new GUIDs
   with "Uppcase" and "Hyphens" toggled, where <nuid> is the number of lines
   containing "uuid" in CaMain.idl, i.e., the result of the bash command:
   $ grep 'uuid(' CaMain.idl | wc -l

2. Paste the Results into a text file uuid.txt

3. Compile replaceuuid.C into replaceuuid.exe (see comments in that file).

4. Run the following DOS commands to replace the GUIDs:
   $ replaceuuid.exe uuid.txt < CaMain.idl > CaMain.tmp
   $ rename CaMain.tmp CaMain.idl

5. The last generated GUID (i.e., the one assigned to the coclass Application)
   must also be edited into the IMPLEMENT_OLECREATE statement
   in the file CaApplication.cpp in a matching format.

6. git commit and push the changes

7. Replace the value of the <Guid> tag with the first generated GUI
   in the .csproj files of all Addon source repositories.
