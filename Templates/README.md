# FEDEM Templates

This is the folder for template model files.
If a model file named `default.fmm` exists in this folder, it will
be read when the FEDEM GUI is launched, or when "New" is invoked.
It is used to store default values on some model quantities,
and can be used to customize the default startup by the user.
