# FEDEM Addons

This is the folder for the Addons of the FEDEM GUI.
They are executables with their own GUIs that can be launched
from the Addons menu of the Main GUI which communicates with them over COM
(windows platform only).

The Addons are not part of the main distribution but are built separately.
