# FEDEM properties

This folder contains the beam cross section database, from which
cross section definitions can be imported into a Fedem model.

It is also the folder for wind turbine blade and property libraries
that may follow an installation. It is populated by a set of model
files (`.fmm`) that will be read each time the Fedem GUI is launched,
or before a new model is opened.
